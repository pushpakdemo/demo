 The National Policy on Education formulated in 1986 and modified in 1992 aims to provide education of a comparable quality up to a given level to all students irrespective of their caste, creed, residence or sex. It aims at promotion of a nationality, a sense of common citizenship, composite culture and national integration. It lays stress on the need for a radical transformation of the education system to improve its quality at all stages and gives much greater attention to Science and Technology.The State Selection Board, Odisha endorses those national aims and objectives and pursues to acheive them.
